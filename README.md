## Dev notes

npm i graphql @graphql-codegen/cli

npm run graphql-codegen init or npx graphql-codegen init
npm run install # install the chosen plugin

npm run generate-types

graphql.schema.json
generated.tsx ==> types and hooks

codegen.yml ==> all configuration

## long route querying from a React app

```
import {useQuery} from '@apollo/client'
...
const {data, error, loading} = useQuery(<theVariableThatContainsTheQueryString>);
```

## short route with the help of codegen

```
// import the query that was autogenerated from the generated.tsx (in this case)
// use it as argument of useQuery
/*
also to leverage the benefits of ts and graphql code generator
specify the types of the result from the query and the types for the input (if any)
and if they are, accept them in the useQuery arguments

*/

  const { data, error, loading } = useQuery<GetLaunchesQuery, GetLaunchesQueryVariables>(GetLaunchesDocument, {variables: id: someId});
```
